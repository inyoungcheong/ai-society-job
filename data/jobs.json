While the specific focus on post-training might not directly address policy or ethics in the job description itself, the nature of AI development inherently carries social implications.  Post-training processes, such as fine-tuning and deployment, are crucial stages where biases can emerge or be mitigated.  An AI engineer working on these aspects could contribute to reducing negative social impacts.  The inclusion of \"Researcher\" in the title further strengthens the link to AI & Society, suggesting potential involvement in research aimed at understanding and improving AI's societal effects.  The company's reputation and the location (Palo Alto, suggesting a tech-heavy environment) also add to the likelihood of the role engaging with AI ethics indirectly.

Cognite is a technology company working with industrial data, meaning the strategic programs could involve AI-driven solutions with significant societal implications.  The use of AI in industrial settings raises ethical concerns regarding worker displacement, environmental impact, and potential biases embedded in algorithms.  A director-level role would likely have influence over the ethical considerations and responsible development of such programs.  However, without more details about the specific program, it's difficult to assess direct involvement in AI ethics or policy. The location in France may suggest potential interaction with EU AI regulations.  The relevance is therefore moderate, leaning more towards the technical application of AI with indirect societal impact rather than direct engagement with AI ethics research or policy.",

This role might involve improving the transparency of AI systems or contributing to the development of responsible AI practices within the company. However, without further details about the job description, it's difficult to definitively determine the degree of AI & Society relevance. The search query \"AI transparency\" further hints at potential overlap, suggesting that AI-related work within the company is a consideration. The lack of explicit mention of AI ethics or policy lowers the relevance score.  The role's likely focus is on internal operational efficiency and transformation, not directly on societal impacts of AI.",

Forensics increasingly involves digital evidence and data analysis, which can intersect with AI-related issues.  Investigations may uncover algorithmic bias, data breaches impacting privacy, or misuse of AI systems. The role's focus on risk management could indirectly involve identifying and mitigating AI-related risks for clients.  However, the job description lacks explicit mention of AI, and its primary focus seems to be on broader forensic investigations.  The 'AI risk management' search query suggests some potential involvement with AI-related challenges, but this is not definitively stated in the provided information. Therefore, the relevance is moderate.",
