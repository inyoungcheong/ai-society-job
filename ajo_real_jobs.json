Aptamers are often obtained through rounds of in vitro competitive selection (SELEX), starting from artificial libraries of large numbers (~10^15) of distinct sequences. When the experiment succeeds, variants that perform the selected function well are enriched from one round to the next, and eventually the library coll...",
